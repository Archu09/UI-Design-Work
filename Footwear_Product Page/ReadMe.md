## Product Landing Page | Frontend Development
This Landing page template was purely done with CSS and HTML 

### Here's quick overview of what I did in this page:

🔹 Organized layout with block & inline elements

🔹 Used advanced selectors for precise styling

🔹 Positioned text & images with CSS positioning

Design is so much fun when you master your CSS! 😍✨
