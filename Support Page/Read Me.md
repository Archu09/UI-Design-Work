Designed this support page 

Here's quick overview of what I did in this page:

🔹 Explored CSS divisions
🔹 Worked with block & inline elements
🔹 Specifically focused on horizontal & vertical alignments

Loved the process of perfecting those design details! 😃✨

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and collaborate!🙏
